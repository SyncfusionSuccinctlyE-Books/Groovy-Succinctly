#Streams

A set of demonstrators for using Java streams with Groovy.

All of the examples read in data from a CSV and the use streams to
perform calculation or prepare data feeds.

Try these to start off with as they build on each other:

1. RainfallDataFilter.groovy: Filters out data
1. RainfallDataMap.groovy: Filters then maps the data
1. RainfallDataCollect.groovy: Filters and maps then conflates the map
1. RainfallDataGroupingBasic.groovy: Filters and maps then creates a by-month summary
1. RainfallDataGrouping.groovy: Maps the data and then groups by year then month
1. RainfallDataSort.groovy: Displays a month's rainfall in descending order

The following files demonstrate calculations:

* RainfallDataSummarizing.groovy: summarizes rainfall data for a specific year
* RainfallDataSum.groovy: determines the total rainfall for the month
* RainfallDataAverage.groovy: determines the average rainfall for the month
* RainfallDataMonthlyAverage.groovy: determines the average monthly rainfall for several years
